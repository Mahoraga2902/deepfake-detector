# Deepfake Video Detection using CNN and Transformer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects deepfake videos using deep learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformer-based architectures. The system analyzes video frames, extracts important facial features, and predicts whether the video is real or fake. The CNN helps capture spatial features such as facial textures and artifacts, while the Transformer model improves detection by learning deeper patterns and relationships across frames.
